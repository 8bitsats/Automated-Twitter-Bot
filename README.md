### Project Overview

The main components of this project include:

1. **Twitter API Integration**: The bot will use the Twitter API v2 to interact with the Twitter platform and post tweets.
2. **Python and Tweepy**: Python will be used as the primary programming language, and the Tweepy library will be utilized to interact with the Twitter API.
3. **Telegram Integration**: The bot will also be integrated with Telegram, allowing it to receive input and trigger tweets.
4. **Automated Tweeting**: The bot will be capable of automatically generating and posting tweets based on predefined rules and conditions.
5. **Azure Function App**: The bot is serverless and runs on the Azure function apps infrastructure.
