5. **Run Tests**: Before submitting your changes, run the necessary tests to ensure that your contributions do not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality. If possible, add new tests to cover your changes.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are complete and tested, submit a pull request to the main Automated-Twitter-Bot repository. Include a descriptive title and a brief explanation of the changes you made.

7. **Respond to Feedback**: Be prepared to respond to feedback and reviews from the project maintainers. Address any issues or concerns raised by the reviewers and make the necessary changes to your branch.

8. **Merge Requirements**: After your pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
